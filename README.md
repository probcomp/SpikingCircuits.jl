# SpikingCircuits.jl

An extension to the `Circuits.jl` library, adding support for Spiking Neural Circuits.  This defines the `Spiking` target,
primitive value / component types for this target, and implements a spiking neural network simulator.

This library is under development and subject to rapid changes.
